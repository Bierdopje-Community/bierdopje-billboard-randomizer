Bierdopje Billboard Randomizer

Version 1.2 (3 November 2016)
Fixed randomizer picking the same number causing billboard getting stuck.
Note: Due to timing issues and not keeping the previous billboard value,
      having the developer tab open will most likely cause the billboard to go default.

Version 1.1 (3 November 2016)
Fixed off-by-one calculation mistake (would stop the rotation at <1% change)

Version 1.0 (2 November 2016)
First release
